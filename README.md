# scss reminder

## Features

- Remind of defined variables

- Quick fix for replacement of defined variables

You will be reminded of the property defined as a variable. In this example, variables are defined in test.scss. You may click and go to the source file(test.scss) to check out the defined variable, or replace the property with the variable name just using quick fix.
